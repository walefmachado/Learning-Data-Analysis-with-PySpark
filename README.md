# Learning Data Analysis with PySpark

This repository was created with the aim of gathering my study material from the PySpark tools for data analysis. Initially the content will be based on the book _Data Analysis with Python and PySpark_ ([RIOUX, 2022.](https://www.manning.com/books/data-analysis-with-python-and-pyspark)), but with the time I will include other materials.
